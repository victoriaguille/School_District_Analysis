# School District Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
####
requested by a school district employee, maria, to perform an analysis using pandas and python. looked at all high schools in the district using grades, budget, and averages. replaced academic dishonesty with nan. broke down the two csv files into several different dfs to compare. 
## Results
####
* changes made in district summary are miniscule. enough data amongst all schools to make up for the removal of fraudulent grades from one grade level in one school. (insert comparison images). 
* breaking data down by school only impacts thomas high, everyone else has the same percentages. nothing changed for the school summary outside of thomas high. 
* removing the data for the ninth graders in thomas significantly boosts the overall percentages of thomas high by at minimum twenty-five percent from original data. averages remain in line with the rest of the schools. w/out 9th grade, thomas high looks like one of the top performing schools. (insert image)
* math and reading scores by grade have little to no impact in total. only difference is now there is "nan" in the 9th grade column for thomas high. 
* amount per student stays the same, so spending per student has little impact
* thomas high is a medium school, enough data to make up for the 460ish students' scores removed to not effect the data
* school type not impacted. same as above, plus charter schools were larger anyways
